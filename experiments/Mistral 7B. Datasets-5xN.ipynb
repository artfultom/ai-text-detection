      "12 Years a Slave: An Analysis of the Film Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2013 film 12 Years a Slave proved that slavery is a worldwide issue. Indeed, the film made $150 million outside the United States and $57 million in the U.S., with a production budget of $20 million (Sharf, 2020). The movie was based on the memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup (Ntim, 2020). It tells the story of a free African American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Solomon spent twelve years away from his family, being traded from one master to another. Fortunately, the protagonist met a person who helped him deliver a message to his family and friends, who came and rescued him. This movie accurately illustrates discriminatory relationships between white slaveholders and black slaves that stemmed from the dysfunctional system in the country and prejudices in people’s mindsets at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main ethnic groups presented in this film are White and African Americans, and the three social groups are affluent slaveholders, working for middle class, and enslaved people. The movie starts with the story of a free African American violinist Solomon Northup, living with his family in Saratoga, New York (McQueen, 2013). However, he was abducted by two white men, who tortured the man and sold him into slavery, changing his name to Plat. Before they met, Solomon and these two slave traders belonged to the same middle class. However, the fact that Northup was an African American made these individuals believe that they had the right to withdraw their freedom. The two masters that Solomon had were William Ford and Edwin Epps (McQueen, 2013). The former was kind and religious, while the latter was cruel and sadistic. Since the movie was based on a real story, it indicated that slaveholders had different characters, but all had the wrong perception of race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although 12 Years a Slave is a film about slavery, the issues of collectivism and individualism are also raised. Specifically, the main character never identified himself as an enslaved man and continued claiming he was a free citizen (McQueen, 2013). However, his counterparts on the plant had a collective mindset, imprinted in them since childhood, that slavery is normal. These people helped each other because they belonged to the same group. Although Solomon tried to become a part of this community, his individual goal to return home was above the collective values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie also showed prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people. For instance, when Ford brings Solomon and Elisa to his plantation, his wife expresses her sadness that Elisa got separated from her children. However, she also stated that “something to eat and some rest” could help that woman forget her children (McQueen, 2013, 32:47-32:51). This scene demonstrated the common prejudice about slaves that they were not capable of the same feelings as white people. An example of generalization and stereotyping was how Tibeats, a carpenter, became hostile to Solomon when he showed his intelligence and gave Ford advice. In fact, Tibeats believed that Plat would never be more competent than any white individual because Plat was a “nigger” (McQueen, 2013, 36:35-36:37). Notably, before Northup became enslaved, he never experienced discrimination, but when the main character was sold into slavery, discrimination was the only attitude that he could observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, 12 Years a Slave depicts the life of enslaved people and slave owners almost two centuries ago. The film narrates a free black man’s life from the moment when he enjoyed his family’s company in the state of New York to his abduction, enslavement, and eventual liberation. Overall, the movie raised such critical issues as discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping, and generalization that allowed slaveholders to maintain this societal structure for a long time.\n",

      "12 Years a Slave: An Analysis of the Film Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "In the annals of cinematic history, few films have managed to elicit such a profound emotional response from audiences as Steve McQueen's \"12 Years a Slave.\" Released in 2013, this powerful and unflinching drama recounts the true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man from New York who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the pre-Civil War South. The film's haunting portrayal of human bondage serves as an unsettling reminder of a dark chapter in American history, inviting viewers to confront the harsh realities of slavery and its enduring impact on individuals and society.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the heart of \"12 Years a Slave\" is Chiwetel Ejiofor's riveting performance as Solomon Northup, a talented musician and educated man who, despite his privileges, becomes a slave through no fault of his own. The film opens with Northup's kidnapping, which unfolds in a harrowing sequence that leaves little room for doubt about the brutal nature of the slave trade. From this point onwards, viewers are drawn into Northup's world, where every day is a struggle for survival and dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most striking aspects of \"12 Years a Slave\" is its unrelenting portrayal of the physical and emotional toll of slavery on both slaves and slave owners. McQueen spares no detail in depicting the brutality of whippings, forced labor, and other forms of abuse that were commonplace in the antebellum South. However, the film also explores the psychological impact of slavery on those who wield power, revealing the complex dynamics between slave owners and their chattel.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prime example of this is the relationship between Northup and his owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a cruel and violent man whose obsession with control extends beyond his slaves to his wife and children. Epps' treatment of Northup serves as a catalyst for much of the film's drama, as the two men circle each other in a dance of power and resistance that ultimately leads to tragic consequences. Fassbender delivers a chilling performance as Epps, capturing both his monstrous cruelty and his vulnerability, making him a deeply human and complex villain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key aspect of \"12 Years a Slave\" is its exploration of the resilience and resourcefulness of enslaved Africans in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Through Northup's eyes, viewers witness acts of small rebellions – from stealing food to plotting escape attempts – that demonstrate the indomitable spirit of those held in bondage. At the same time, the film shows how these acts of resistance were often met with brutal retaliation, highlighting the dangerous and precarious nature of life as a slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "McQueen's direction is masterful throughout \"12 Years a Slave,\" using striking visuals to convey the film's themes of oppression, resistance, and hope. From the opening scene, which depicts Northup playing his violin against a backdrop of rolling hills, to the climactic moment when he is reunited with his family, McQueen employs powerful imagery that lingers long after the credits roll. His use of long takes and unbroken shots adds to the film's sense of immersion, allowing viewers to fully absorb the weight of Northup's experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technical aspects of \"12 Years a Slave\" are equally impressive. Lukas Forchinger's cinematography captures the stark beauty of the southern landscape while also conveying the claustrophobic atmosphere of plantation life. Hans Zimmer's haunting score complements the visuals, evoking both the pain and the hope that drive Northup and his fellow slaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, \"12 Years a Slave\" is a powerful and poignant film that offers a searing exploration of slavery in America, its impact on individuals and society, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Through Chiwetel Ejiofor's riveting performance as Solomon Northup and Steve McQueen's masterful direction, this film offers a haunting reminder of a dark chapter in American history that continues to resonate today. It is a must-see for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of slavery and its enduring impact on our collective consciousness.\n",

      "The narrative structure of 12 Years a Slave is intricately woven around themes of survival, identity, and human degradation. At its core, it explores the psychological impact of slavery on both enslaved individuals and their slave-owning oppressors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identity Crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "Solomon Northup's character experiences a significant identity crisis as he struggles to maintain his self-worth and dignity while being held captive. His ability to read and write sets him apart from other slaves, making him a valuable commodity for his masters but also rendering him vulnerable to their exploitation. This conflict is poignantly illustrated in a scene where Northup reads aloud from the Bible, providing solace and hope to himself and other enslaved people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Survival and Resilience\n",
      "\n",
      "The film underscores the brutal reality of slavery through its portrayal of the survival tactics employed by enslaved individuals. These range from subtle acts of defiance, such as stealing food or sabotaging tools, to more overt rebellions that often result in severe punishment or death. One particularly memorable scene involves a group of slaves attempting to escape via a makeshift raft, only to be caught and mercilessly punished by their masters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Degradation\n",
      "\n",
      "The dehumanizing effects of slavery are explored through the depiction of various forms of physical and emotional abuse inflicted upon enslaved individuals. For instance, there is the brutal whipping scene involving Channing Watson's character, Edwin Epps, and his slave Patsey. This scene not only showcases the violence inherent in slavery but also highlights the cruel power dynamics at play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symbolism of the Tree\n",
      "\n",
      "A notable symbolic element in 12 Years a Slave is the tree under which Solomon Northup prays for freedom and reunion with his family. The tree functions as a powerful reminder of hope amidst despair, resilience in the face of adversity, and the enduring human spirit. It also serves to underscore the importance of faith and perseverance during times of hardship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "12 Years a Slave is an essential film that sheds light on the harsh realities of American slavery and its profound impact on both enslaved individuals and their oppressors. Through its intricately woven narrative, the movie offers a poignant exploration of themes such as identity, survival, resilience, and human degradation. By presenting these complex issues with unflinching honesty, 12 Years a Slave serves as a powerful reminder of our collective past and the importance of learning from it.\n",

      "Example length: 600 words\n",
      "\n",
      "Example output:\n",
      "The 2013 film 12 Years a Slave proved that slavery is a worldwide issue. Indeed, the film made $150 million outside the United States and $57 million in the U.S., with a production budget of $20 million (Sharf, 2020). The movie was based on the memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup (Ntim, 2020). It tells the story of a free African American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Solomon spent twelve years away from his family, being traded from one master to another. Fortunately, the protagonist met a person who helped him deliver a message to his family and friends, who came and rescued him. This movie accurately illustrates discriminatory relationships between white slaveholders and black slaves that stemmed from the dysfunctional system in the country and prejudices in people’s mindsets at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main ethnic groups presented in this film are White and African Americans, and the three social groups are affluent slaveholders, working for middle class, and enslaved people. The movie starts with the story of a free African American violinist Solomon Northup, living with his family in Saratoga, New York (McQueen, 2013). However, he was abducted by two white men, who tortured the man and sold him into slavery, changing his name to Plat. Before they met, Solomon and these two slave traders belonged to the same middle class. However, the fact that Northup was an African American made these individuals believe that they had the right to withdraw their freedom. The two masters that Solomon had were William Ford and Edwin Epps (McQueen, 2013). The former was kind and religious, while the latter was cruel and sadistic. Since the movie was based on a real story, it indicated that slaveholders had different characters, but all had the wrong perception of race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although 12 Years a Slave is a film about slavery, the issues of collectivism and individualism are also raised. Specifically, the main character never identified himself as an enslaved man and continued claiming he was a free citizen (McQueen, 2013). However, his counterparts on the plant had a collective mindset, imprinted in them since childhood, that slavery is normal. These people helped each other because they belonged to the same group. Although Solomon tried to become a part of this community, his individual goal to return home was above the collective values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie also showed prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people. For instance, when Ford brings Solomon and Elisa to his plantation, his wife expresses her sadness that Elisa got separated from her children. However, she also stated that “something to eat and some rest” could help that woman forget her children (McQueen, 2013, 32:47-32:51). This scene demonstrated the common prejudice about slaves that they were not capable of the same feelings as white people. An example of generalization and stereotyping was how Tibeats, a carpenter, became hostile to Solomon when he showed his intelligence and gave Ford advice. In fact, Tibeats believed that Plat would never be more competent than any white individual because Plat was a “nigger” (McQueen, 2013, 36:35-36:37). Notably, before Northup became enslaved, he never experienced discrimination, but when the main character was sold into slavery, discrimination was the only attitude that he could observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, 12 Years a Slave depicts the life of enslaved people and slave owners almost two centuries ago. The film narrates a free black man’s life from the moment when he enjoyed his family’s company in the state of New York to his abduction, enslavement, and eventual liberation. Overall, the movie raised such critical issues as discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping, and generalization that allowed slaveholders to maintain this societal structure for a long time.\n",
