      "12 Years a Slave: An Analysis of the Film Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2013 film 12 Years a Slave proved that slavery is a worldwide issue. Indeed, the film made $150 million outside the United States and $57 million in the U.S., with a production budget of $20 million (Sharf, 2020). The movie was based on the memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup (Ntim, 2020). It tells the story of a free African American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Solomon spent twelve years away from his family, being traded from one master to another. Fortunately, the protagonist met a person who helped him deliver a message to his family and friends, who came and rescued him. This movie accurately illustrates discriminatory relationships between white slaveholders and black slaves that stemmed from the dysfunctional system in the country and prejudices in people’s mindsets at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main ethnic groups presented in this film are White and African Americans, and the three social groups are affluent slaveholders, working for middle class, and enslaved people. The movie starts with the story of a free African American violinist Solomon Northup, living with his family in Saratoga, New York (McQueen, 2013). However, he was abducted by two white men, who tortured the man and sold him into slavery, changing his name to Plat. Before they met, Solomon and these two slave traders belonged to the same middle class. However, the fact that Northup was an African American made these individuals believe that they had the right to withdraw their freedom. The two masters that Solomon had were William Ford and Edwin Epps (McQueen, 2013). The former was kind and religious, while the latter was cruel and sadistic. Since the movie was based on a real story, it indicated that slaveholders had different characters, but all had the wrong perception of race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although 12 Years a Slave is a film about slavery, the issues of collectivism and individualism are also raised. Specifically, the main character never identified himself as an enslaved man and continued claiming he was a free citizen (McQueen, 2013). However, his counterparts on the plant had a collective mindset, imprinted in them since childhood, that slavery is normal. These people helped each other because they belonged to the same group. Although Solomon tried to become a part of this community, his individual goal to return home was above the collective values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie also showed prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people. For instance, when Ford brings Solomon and Elisa to his plantation, his wife expresses her sadness that Elisa got separated from her children. However, she also stated that “something to eat and some rest” could help that woman forget her children (McQueen, 2013, 32:47-32:51). This scene demonstrated the common prejudice about slaves that they were not capable of the same feelings as white people. An example of generalization and stereotyping was how Tibeats, a carpenter, became hostile to Solomon when he showed his intelligence and gave Ford advice. In fact, Tibeats believed that Plat would never be more competent than any white individual because Plat was a “nigger” (McQueen, 2013, 36:35-36:37). Notably, before Northup became enslaved, he never experienced discrimination, but when the main character was sold into slavery, discrimination was the only attitude that he could observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, 12 Years a Slave depicts the life of enslaved people and slave owners almost two centuries ago. The film narrates a free black man’s life from the moment when he enjoyed his family’s company in the state of New York to his abduction, enslavement, and eventual liberation. Overall, the movie raised such critical issues as discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping, and generalization that allowed slaveholders to maintain this societal structure for a long time.\n",

      "A Growing Market: Restructuring P&G Research Paper\n",
      "\n",
      "The consumer goods industry is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by digital transformation, evolving consumer expectations, and intensified global competition, a reality that has compelled even the most established giants to fundamentally rethink their operational paradigms. For Procter & Gamble (P&G), a corporation built on a legendary legacy of in-house research and development, this has necessitated a profound restructuring of its innovation model, moving from a closed, internal system to an open, networked ecosystem. This strategic pivot is not merely an operational adjustment but a necessary evolution to capture growth in a market that increasingly values speed, agility, and external collaboration. The restructuring of P&G’s research and development, famously encapsulated in the “Connect + Develop” initiative, represents a sophisticated response to the limitations of traditional R&D, leveraging external partnerships to accelerate innovation while optimizing internal resources for maximum impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, P&G’s success was rooted in its formidable internal R&D capabilities, with massive central laboratories like those in Cincinnati serving as the sole engine for new products. However, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, this model showed signs of strain. The cost of maintaining such a vast internal apparatus was enormous, and the pace of innovation was often perceived as too slow in a marketplace where consumer trends and technological advancements were accelerating. The company faced stagnating growth and pressure from more nimble competitors. The insight that catalyzed change was the recognition that the vast majority of useful knowledge and potential innovations existed outside the company’s walls. This led to the formal launch of Connect + Develop, a strategy that explicitly sought to source a significant percentage of innovations from external partners, including universities, startups, suppliers, and even competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restructuring of P&G’s R&D function under this model involved a dual transformation: opening the aperture for inbound innovation and strategically focusing internal efforts. Externally, the company established a formal infrastructure to scout, evaluate, and integrate external ideas. This included dedicated teams, online portals for submission, and a cultural shift that celebrated “proudly found elsewhere” as much as internally invented. Internally, the role of R&D evolved from being the sole originator to becoming the essential integrator and scaler. P&G’s deep expertise in consumer understanding, branding, manufacturing, and global supply chains became the value it brought to partnerships, transforming promising external technologies into commercially successful, globally scaled products. Examples abound, from the revolutionary SpinBrush, which was an acquired invention, to the core technology in Olay Regenerist, sourced from a small French company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implications of this restructuring for capturing growth in a growing but fragmented market are multifaceted. First, it dramatically increases the innovation pipeline’s volume and diversity, allowing P&G to tap into niche technologies and regional trends that would be inefficient to develop in-house. This is crucial in an era where hyper-personalization and regional preferences are key growth drivers. Second, it enhances speed-to-market, a critical competitive advantage. By leveraging ready-made solutions, the company can shorten development cycles, allowing it to respond swiftly to emerging consumer demands. Third, it optimizes R&D expenditure, freeing capital to be deployed more strategically on core, differentiating research and on the commercialization of partnered innovations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the restructuring of P&G’s research paradigm is a case study in corporate adaptation. It demonstrates that in a growing and dynamic market, sustainable growth is less about owning every piece of the innovation process and more about curating the best ecosystem. By transforming its R&D from an isolated fortress into a connected hub, P&G has not only rejuvenated its product portfolio but also redefined its organizational identity. The company now operates as a central node in a global network of innovation, where its primary competitive advantage lies in its unique ability to identify, refine, and magnify great ideas, regardless of their origin. This open architecture for innovation positions P&G not just to participate in the growing market, but to actively shape it.\n",

      "A Growing Market: Restructuring P&G Research Paper\n",
      "\n",
      "Background Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The consumer goods industry is characterized by intense competition, rapidly shifting consumer preferences, and the relentless pressure of digital transformation. For a global behemoth like Procter & Gamble P&G, maintaining market leadership requires not only product innovation but also profound organizational agility. In recent years, a significant component of P&G's strategy has been the restructuring of its research and development R&D operations. This strategic pivot is not merely a cost-cutting exercise but a fundamental reimagining of how innovation is sourced, developed, and brought to market. It represents a deliberate shift from a closed, internal model to an open, networked ecosystem, designed to accelerate growth in a dynamic global marketplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Imperative for Change\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades, P&G’s innovation engine was largely insular, relying on its vast internal R&D capabilities housed in large central facilities. While this model yielded iconic products like Tide and Pampers, it began to show limitations in speed and breadth. The rise of niche competitors, the explosion of e-commerce, and the demand for hyper-personalization exposed the risks of a slow, monolithic R&D structure. The Connect + Develop program, launched in the early 2000s, marked the initial recognition of this need, seeking external partnerships. However, the contemporary restructuring goes further, embedding openness into the organizational core. The imperative is clear: to tap into a global pool of ideas and technologies faster than ever before, reducing time-to-market and leveraging external expertise in areas like digital technology, biotechnology, and materials science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core Elements of the R&D Restructuring\n",
      "\n",
      "The restructuring of P&G’s research paradigm revolves around three interconnected elements. First is the physical and organizational decentralization of R&D efforts. Instead of concentrating research in a few mega-centers, P&G has established smaller, agile innovation hubs in key growth markets and technology hotspots around the world. These hubs, such as those in Singapore, Beijing, and Tel Aviv, are positioned to identify local consumer trends and partner with regional startups and academic institutions. Second is the deepened commitment to open innovation. P&G actively scouts for externally developed technologies that can be integrated into its product pipeline, using digital platforms and venture capital arms to connect with innovators. Third, and crucially, is the integration of digital tools and data analytics into the R&D process itself. From using AI to predict consumer trends and optimize formulations to employing virtual prototyping, technology accelerates every stage of development, making the research process more efficient and predictive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategic Benefits and Market Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "This restructuring is fundamentally a growth-oriented strategy. By opening its innovation funnel, P&G gains access to a wider array of ideas, mitigating the risk of internal groupthink and accelerating the innovation cycle. For instance, partnerships with chemical startups can lead to novel sustainable materials, while collaborations with tech firms can embed smart sensors into home care products. This approach allows P&G to enter adjacent markets and develop premium, technology-driven products that command higher margins. Furthermore, the localized hubs enable faster adaptation of global brands to regional preferences, a critical advantage in diverse markets like Asia and Africa. The restructuring thus transforms R&D from a cost center into a dynamic engine for market expansion and competitive differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges and Future Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its advantages, this new model presents significant challenges. Managing a dispersed network of partners requires robust intellectual property frameworks and complex coordination, posing risks of leakage and integration failures. The cultural shift from a \"not invented here\" mentality to one of collaborative innovation is an ongoing process that demands strong leadership. Looking ahead, the success of P&G’s restructured research apparatus will depend on its ability to balance external sourcing with deep internal expertise, ensuring that core brand identities are maintained while embracing external innovation. As the market continues to evolve, P&G’s experiment serves as a seminal case study in how legacy corporations can reinvent their innovation processes to thrive in a connected, fast-paced global economy.\n",

      "Example length: 600 words\n",
      "\n",
      "Example output:\n",
      "The business world is ever-changing, and companies must always be flexible to these changes. One of the changes that a business might need to adapt to is an expanding target market. P&G currently sells personal care products to a market that is comprised primarily of women. However, research shows that there is a growing market among male consumers due to the rise of male grooming. P&G should restructure to take advantage of the new market for men’s care products.\n",
      "\n",
      "P&G will need to make several changes to capitalize on the “ignored” market. The restructuring will affect various departments such as research and development, product design, and sales and marketing. Their redesign will affect their employee recruitment and selection practices (Szymczyk, 2016). For instance, currently, most employees that deal with skin and hair care products, cosmetics, and fragrances are female. This is because the target market is mostly women, which means that the products are probably developed, designed, and marketed by women. To attract a new target audience of men, the company will need to hire more male employees (Nadube & Didia, 2018). Male consumers will be more satisfied with male-only personal care products. These products are best developed by people who are male themselves and understand what other men would want. The research and development, product design, and sales and marketing departments must comprise more male employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main contextual variable that led to P&G’s restructuring was the changes in the target market as revealed by a study. The study was conducted by Male Grooming Trends: Profiting in 2009 and Beyond. It showed that although female consumers dominated the market for personal grooming products, the market for male consumers was quickly expanding. P&G saw an opportunity to profit from an expanding market. Therefore, redesigning was necessitated by changes in the market characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several companies have restructured to capitalize on a larger target market. Examples include Harley Davidson Motorcycles, NFL, and Stryx. Traditionally, the demographic market for motorcycles was older white men. However, following a decrease in motorcycle sales, Harley Davidson started targeting female customers (Moreno, 2017). They customized their bikes to women’s needs and found creative ways to market these bikes to women. Second, the National Football League discovered in a study that women comprised over 40% of their viewership (Townes, 2019). They then expanded their target market beyond the usual male customers and started to make merchandise for women. Finally, Stryx is a company that has capitalized on the growing market for male makeup products. The companies mentioned have been widely successful in expanding their markets. Other companies should also capitalize on their expanding target market. For instance, traditionally male-dominated gyms should consider opening women-only gyms. Although women are now exercising just as much as men, there are not enough gyms for them. Overall, companies should be quick to adapt to changes in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, companies should keep up-to-date with any changes in the market. All industries are constantly evolving, and it would be unwise for businesses to stick to old ways. In the given case study, P&G has the potential to generate profit from a new market for personal care products. It will need to redesign its recruitment practices to exploit this opportunity. Restructuring for a new reality can be a profitable venture if done correctly as shown by Harley Davidson, NFL, and Stryx.\n",

      "A Manager’s Power Bases in a Healthcare Setting Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The effective functioning of a healthcare institution hinges not only on clinical expertise but also on the nuanced application of managerial power, a concept famously categorized by French and Raven into five bases: legitimate, reward, coercive, expert, and referent power. In the high-stakes, collaborative environment of healthcare, a manager’s reliance on certain power bases over others can profoundly impact staff morale, patient outcomes, and organizational culture. A balanced and strategic application, favoring expert and referent power while cautiously employing legitimate, reward, and coercive power, is essential for fostering a climate of trust, innovation, and high-quality care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legitimate power, derived from one’s formal position within the organizational hierarchy, is a fundamental starting point for any healthcare manager, such as a head nurse or department chair. This authority grants the manager the right to make scheduling decisions, assign duties, and enforce institutional policies. While necessary for maintaining order and accountability, an over-reliance on legitimate power alone can breed resentment and a culture of mere compliance, stifling the professional autonomy so valued by clinicians. Therefore, this power base is most effective when used as a foundational framework within which more persuasive forms of influence operate. Similarly, reward and coercive power—the ability to provide benefits or impose punishments—are double-edged swords. A manager can positively utilize reward power by advocating for professional development opportunities, merit-based bonuses, or public recognition for exceptional work. Conversely, coercive power, manifested through reprimands, unfavorable assignments, or threats of disciplinary action, can quickly erode trust. In a setting where psychological safety is linked to error reporting and team communication, excessive coercion can create a climate of fear, directly jeopardizing patient safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, the most sustainable and effective power bases in healthcare are expert and referent power. Expert power stems from a manager’s own clinical knowledge, experience, and proven judgment. A physician-manager who is respected for their diagnostic acumen or a nurse administrator known for their adeptness with complex patient care protocols commands influence through demonstrated competence. Staff are more likely to follow guidance and embrace new protocols when they trust the manager’s expertise, viewing directives not as arbitrary orders but as clinically sound decisions. This is particularly crucial during crises, such as implementing a new infection control procedure, where staff need to believe in the scientific rationale behind the change. Complementing expert power is referent power, which arises from a manager’s personal attributes, charisma, and the strength of their interpersonal relationships. A manager who is empathetic, fair, and consistently supports their team builds profound loyalty. When staff admire and identify with their manager, they are motivated to exert discretionary effort, collaborate more openly, and align their personal goals with the unit’s objectives. This relational power is invaluable for navigating the interpersonal complexities and emotional burdens inherent in healthcare work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of these power bases is where true managerial artistry lies. A successful healthcare manager might use their legitimate power to initiate a change in patient handoff procedures, but they will rely on their expert power to explain the evidence-based benefits for patient safety and employ referent power to engage staff in refining the process, making them feel valued partners. They will use reward power to celebrate the team’s successful adoption of the new protocol, while the latent presence of coercive power (for willful non-compliance) remains a rarely invoked backdrop. Ultimately, the goal is to cultivate a professional environment where authority is respected not because it is mandated, but because it is perceived as knowledgeable and benevolent. In this way, a manager’s power becomes less about personal control and more about empowering others, channeling collective expertise toward the singular aim of exemplary patient care. The most resilient and high-performing healthcare units are often those led by managers who understand that their greatest power lies in fostering the power of their team.\n",

      "**I. Introduction**\n",
      "*   Establish the context of a mature, highly competitive global consumer goods market in the early 2000s, where P&G faced stagnating growth, brand proliferation, and organizational complexity.\n",
      "*   Present the central argument: P&G’s multi-faceted restructuring was a deliberate strategic pivot from expansion to disciplined focus, designed to drive sustainable growth in a challenging environment.\n",

      "*   Analyze the divestiture of non-core brands (e.g., food products) and the strategic acquisition of high-growth, high-margin segments (e.g., Gillette) as a move to streamline the portfolio around daily-use household and personal care categories.\n",
      "*   Discuss the rationale of concentrating resources on fewer, larger “leadership brands” to achieve scale, sharpen marketing focus, and increase investment efficiency in research and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Main Body: Thematic Section 2 – Organizational Restructuring for Agility and Efficiency**\n",
      "*   Examine the shift from a geographically-based matrix structure to a simplified, integrated global business unit (GBU) structure, designed to reduce internal friction, accelerate decision-making, and foster global brand consistency.\n",
      "*   Evaluate the implementation of cost-saving initiatives (e.g., “Productivity 2.0”) and supply chain optimization as essential enablers that funded increased brand investment and innovation while improving profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Main Body: Thematic Section 3 – Re-engineering Innovation and Consumer Connectivity**\n",
      "*   Argue that restructuring enabled a more disciplined, consumer-centric innovation model, moving from technology-push to market-pull strategies, exemplified by initiatives like “Connect + Develop” for open innovation.\n",
      "*   Assess how the streamlined organization enhanced P&G’s ability to leverage digital tools and data analytics for deeper consumer insights, more targeted marketing, and faster product iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**V. Counterarguments / Alternative Perspectives**\n",
      "*   Acknowledge critiques that such large-scale restructuring can initially disrupt morale, lead to short-term revenue volatility, and risk over-focus, potentially missing emerging niche market opportunities.\n",
      "*   Consider the alternative strategic perspective that continuous, incremental adaptation might have been preferable to a radical overhaul, or that a greater emphasis on disruptive, rather than sustaining, innovation was needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VI. Conclusion**\n",
      "*   Synthesize the evidence to affirm that P&G’s restructuring successfully addressed its growth crisis by creating a more focused, agile, and consumer-responsive organization, as evidenced by improved financial metrics and brand health in the subsequent decade.\n",
      "*   Conclude by contextualizing P&G’s experience as a seminal case study in strategic corporate renewal, highlighting the imperative for established market leaders to periodically streamline and refocus to sustain growth in evolving global markets.\n",

      "A Growing Market: Restructuring P&G Research Paper\n",

      "**A Growing Market: Restructuring P&G**\n",
      "\n",
      "By the dawn of the 21st century, Procter & Gamble (P&G), the venerable titan of consumer goods, found itself navigating a paradox of its own making. Operating in a mature and fiercely competitive global market, the company was burdened by stagnating growth, an unwieldy proliferation of brands, and stifling organizational complexity. Its expansive portfolio and matrixed management structure, once engines of growth, had become impediments to agility and focus. In response, P&G embarked on a comprehensive strategic restructuring in the mid-2000s, a decisive pivot from unchecked expansion to disciplined concentration. This essay argues that P&G’s multi-faceted restructuring—characterized by portfolio rationalization, organizational simplification, and a renewed focus on core innovation—was a necessary and effective response to market saturation, ultimately enabling the corporation to reclaim growth by enhancing operational agility, strengthening its brand portfolio, and delivering superior shareholder value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cornerstone of P&G’s renewal was a strategic portfolio rationalization, embodying a “back to basics” philosophy. This involved the deliberate divestiture of non-core, lower-margin businesses, such as its food products division (including Jif and Crisco), which, while profitable, did not align with its core expertise in daily-use household and personal care. Concurrently, P&G made the landmark acquisition of Gillette in 2005, a move that consolidated its leadership in male grooming and added a suite of powerhouse brands. This dual strategy of pruning and targeted acquisition streamlined the portfolio around fewer, larger “leadership brands.” The rationale was clear: by concentrating financial, managerial, and R&D resources on these core franchises, P&G could achieve greater scale, sharpen its marketing focus, and dramatically improve investment efficiency. This focus allowed for deeper innovation and more powerful global marketing campaigns for flagship brands like Tide and Pampers, moving them from mere products to dominant category leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "To support this refined portfolio, P&G undertook a profound organizational restructuring designed to inject agility and efficiency into its global operations. The company dismantled its complex, geographically-oriented matrix structure, which often created internal friction and duplicated efforts, and replaced it with a simplified, integrated Global Business Unit (GBU) model. Each GBU, organized by product category (e.g., Fabric & Home Care), was granted full global profit-and-loss responsibility. This shift accelerated decision-making, fostered global brand consistency, and eliminated layers of bureaucracy. Complementing this structural change were rigorous cost-saving initiatives like “Productivity 2.0,” which targeted savings in manufacturing, supply chain, and marketing overhead. The billions freed through these efficiency drives were not merely returned to shareholders but were strategically reinvested into brand building and innovation, creating a virtuous cycle of margin improvement and growth funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the restructuring fundamentally re-engineered P&G’s approach to innovation and consumer connectivity. The streamlined organization enabled a shift from a scattered, technology-push model to a disciplined, consumer-centric, market-pull strategy. The celebrated “Connect + Develop” program exemplified this, opening the company’s innovation process to external partners, universities, and inventors, thereby leveraging global expertise while reducing internal R&D costs and time-to-market. Moreover, the simplified structure enhanced P&G’s ability to harness digital tools and data analytics. With clearer lines of responsibility, GBUs could more effectively utilize consumer data for deeper insights, enabling more targeted marketing, faster product iteration, and a more responsive innovation pipeline attuned to evolving consumer needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, this strategic overhaul was not without its critics or risks. Some perspectives argue that such radical restructuring can initially disrupt corporate morale, lead to short-term revenue volatility from divestitures, and risk an over-focus that blinds the company to emerging niche markets. An alternative strategic viewpoint might posit that continuous, incremental adaptation could have been preferable to a sweeping overhaul, or that P&G should have placed even greater emphasis on disruptive, rather than sustaining, innovation to truly capture new growth vectors. These critiques highlight the inherent tensions in corporate renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the evidence affirms that P&G’s restructuring successfully addressed its growth crisis. By creating a more focused, agile, and consumer-responsive organization, the company strengthened its financial performance and brand health in the subsequent decade, as reflected in improved profit margins, stock price appreciation, and sustained market leadership. P&G’s experience stands as a seminal case study in strategic corporate renewal, demonstrating the imperative for established market leaders to periodically streamline and refocus to sustain growth in evolving, saturated markets. The implications for future corporate strategy are clear: success lies in maintaining a disciplined balance between core focus and the operational flexibility required to adapt to relentless change in consumer behavior and digital paradigms.\n",
