      "12 Years a Slave: An Analysis of the Film Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2013 film 12 Years a Slave proved that slavery is a worldwide issue. Indeed, the film made $150 million outside the United States and $57 million in the U.S., with a production budget of $20 million (Sharf, 2020). The movie was based on the memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup (Ntim, 2020). It tells the story of a free African American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Solomon spent twelve years away from his family, being traded from one master to another. Fortunately, the protagonist met a person who helped him deliver a message to his family and friends, who came and rescued him. This movie accurately illustrates discriminatory relationships between white slaveholders and black slaves that stemmed from the dysfunctional system in the country and prejudices in people’s mindsets at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main ethnic groups presented in this film are White and African Americans, and the three social groups are affluent slaveholders, working for middle class, and enslaved people. The movie starts with the story of a free African American violinist Solomon Northup, living with his family in Saratoga, New York (McQueen, 2013). However, he was abducted by two white men, who tortured the man and sold him into slavery, changing his name to Plat. Before they met, Solomon and these two slave traders belonged to the same middle class. However, the fact that Northup was an African American made these individuals believe that they had the right to withdraw their freedom. The two masters that Solomon had were William Ford and Edwin Epps (McQueen, 2013). The former was kind and religious, while the latter was cruel and sadistic. Since the movie was based on a real story, it indicated that slaveholders had different characters, but all had the wrong perception of race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although 12 Years a Slave is a film about slavery, the issues of collectivism and individualism are also raised. Specifically, the main character never identified himself as an enslaved man and continued claiming he was a free citizen (McQueen, 2013). However, his counterparts on the plant had a collective mindset, imprinted in them since childhood, that slavery is normal. These people helped each other because they belonged to the same group. Although Solomon tried to become a part of this community, his individual goal to return home was above the collective values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie also showed prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people. For instance, when Ford brings Solomon and Elisa to his plantation, his wife expresses her sadness that Elisa got separated from her children. However, she also stated that “something to eat and some rest” could help that woman forget her children (McQueen, 2013, 32:47-32:51). This scene demonstrated the common prejudice about slaves that they were not capable of the same feelings as white people. An example of generalization and stereotyping was how Tibeats, a carpenter, became hostile to Solomon when he showed his intelligence and gave Ford advice. In fact, Tibeats believed that Plat would never be more competent than any white individual because Plat was a “nigger” (McQueen, 2013, 36:35-36:37). Notably, before Northup became enslaved, he never experienced discrimination, but when the main character was sold into slavery, discrimination was the only attitude that he could observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, 12 Years a Slave depicts the life of enslaved people and slave owners almost two centuries ago. The film narrates a free black man’s life from the moment when he enjoyed his family’s company in the state of New York to his abduction, enslavement, and eventual liberation. Overall, the movie raised such critical issues as discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping, and generalization that allowed slaveholders to maintain this societal structure for a long time.\n",

      "Mulan Disney Film Directed by Bancroft & Cook Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1998 Disney animated film *Mulan*, directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, transcends the conventional princess narrative to deliver a powerful commentary on gender, identity, and familial duty within a framework of spectacular entertainment. While drawing loose inspiration from the ancient Chinese ballad of Hua Mulan, the film ingeniously adapts its source material for a contemporary audience, utilizing the animated musical format to explore themes of self-actualization. The central conflict arises not from a traditional villain, but from the rigid societal expectations that confine Mulan; her journey to save her father by posing as a male soldier, Ping, becomes a metaphor for the struggle to prove one’s intrinsic worth beyond prescribed gender roles. Crucially, Mulan’s success is not achieved through supernatural aid or brute strength alone, but through her intelligence, resilience, and innovative thinking, as exemplified in her pivotal defeat of the Hun army using a single rocket. This narrative choice reinforces the film’s core message that true honor comes from authenticity and courage of conscience. Furthermore, the directors skillfully balance this thematic weight with vibrant animation, memorable musical numbers, and comedic relief, largely provided by Eddie Murphy’s Mushu, ensuring broad appeal. The film’s cultural impact is significant, offering a heroine whose value is defined by her mind and spirit, challenging the passive archetypes prevalent in earlier animated features. Ultimately, Bancroft and Cook’s *Mulan* succeeds as both a captivating adventure and a substantive cultural text, arguing persuasively that identity is a complex tapestry of individual merit, loyalty, and personal truth, rather than a simple adherence to societal decree.\n",

      "Mulan Disney Film Directed by Bancroft & Cook Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "Background Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1998 animated film Mulan, directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, stands as a significant entry in the Disney Renaissance canon. It distinguishes itself by adapting the ancient Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, a young woman who disguises herself as a man to take her ailing father’s place in the imperial army. While adhering to the musical and comedic traditions of Disney animation, the film navigates complex themes of gender, identity, and familial honor, setting it apart from more conventional princess narratives. Its creation involved extensive cultural research, though it has been the subject of ongoing discourse regarding its representation of Chinese culture and its modifications to the original source material.\n",
      "\n",
      "Narrative and Thematic Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The film’s central thematic thrust is the subversion of traditional gender roles. Mulan’s journey is framed by her failure to conform to the rigid expectations of femininity, as satirized in the matchmaking song “Honor to Us All.” Her decision to impersonate a male soldier, Ping, becomes an act of both filial piety and personal defiance. The narrative cleverly uses her disguise to explore how identity is performed; Mulan must learn masculine-coded behaviors to survive, yet her ultimate success hinges not on brute strength but on her intelligence, ingenuity, and unconventional thinking, as demonstrated when she uses a rocket to trigger an avalanche. This resolution argues that true heroism and value are derived from individual character rather than gender.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cultural Adaptation and Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "Bancroft and Cook’s adaptation necessarily simplifies and Westernizes the ancient ballad for a global audience. The inclusion of comedic sidekicks like Mushu the dragon and the lucky cricket Cri-Kee follows Disney’s commercial formula, injecting humor but also diverting from the legend’s more solemn tone. The film’s visual style, inspired by Chinese landscape painting, and its incorporation of cultural elements like ancestor veneration demonstrate an effort toward authenticity. However, scholars note that the portrayal remains a filtered interpretation, blending Chinese motifs with a distinctly American narrative about individualism and self-discovery. This synthesis makes the story accessible but also invites critique regarding cultural appropriation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Mulan represents a pivotal attempt by Disney to expand its narrative scope during the Renaissance era. Through the directorial vision of Bancroft and Cook, the film delivers an empowering story that challenges gender norms and celebrates cleverness over brute force. While its cultural representations are a negotiated blend of authenticity and commercial entertainment, its core message about integrity and self-sacrifice resonates universally. The film thus occupies a unique space as both a popular animated musical and a text that invites deeper analysis of identity and cross-cultural storytelling.\n",

      "One of the most popular Disney movies to date, Bankroft’s Mulan, which was released in 1998, presents a captivating story in a unique setting. In their work, the writers challenge the very norms of society to present a highly charismatic set of characters. In this essay, the changes in Mulan’s identity as a woman that are shown to the audience in the first part of the movie will be discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the very beginning, it becomes clear that the gender roles in the movie are expected to be strictly upheld within society. The norms of the ancient Chinese community are clearly shown from the first minutes of the movie, as Mulan is being prepared to be wed (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 0:6:30). Her role as a woman is to bring honor to her family (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 0:6:57). Although she initially attempts to fit in, this setup is only an obstacle in Mulan’s path to the future she herself decides to choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rejection Mulan receives is a critical point for her character. She understands that she will never succeed at the path that is not her own (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 0:12:05). However, choosing one’s fate as a woman of that era is a nigh-impossible task. Honor is what pushes Mulan to make a decision to challenge the otherwise predefined role that was set for her and take her father’s place in the army.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Mulan experiences a shocking revelation that she will not succeed as a woman in this community, making her rethink the very meaning of honor on which her goal was set. She decides to choose her role herself, showing immense strength of character, care, and true devotion for her family. In this strictly hierarchical setting, Mulan’s actions are a challenge to the very foundation of society.\n",

      "Multicultural Food Marketing Techniques Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The global marketplace is no longer a collection of distinct national economies but a deeply interconnected web where consumer tastes are increasingly shaped by cross-cultural influences, making the marketing of food products a complex exercise in cultural translation and sensitivity. Effective multicultural food marketing transcends mere translation of language on packaging; it requires a nuanced understanding of cultural values, dietary practices, historical contexts, and symbolic meanings attached to food. Successful techniques in this domain generally converge on a strategic triad: authentic cultural representation, adaptive product development, and community-centric engagement, all of which must be executed with a foundational respect for the cultures being engaged to avoid the pitfalls of stereotyping or cultural appropriation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authentic cultural representation is the cornerstone of credible multicultural marketing. This involves moving beyond superficial clichés—such as using generic \"Asian\" motifs or sombreros for Mexican products—and investing in deep cultural research. It means understanding regional variations; for instance, marketing a curry product requires specificity, as the culinary traditions of Punjab, Thailand, and Japan are profoundly different. Visual storytelling through packaging and advertising that reflects real people, authentic settings, and traditional preparation methods builds trust. A powerful technique is the incorporation of cultural narratives or heritage stories on packaging, explaining the origin of a dish or the significance of an ingredient within a particular community. For example, a brand marketing harissa might detail its Berber roots and its role in North African communal dining, thereby adding intangible value and educating a broader audience. This authenticity must extend to influencer partnerships, collaborating with cultural ambassadors, chefs, and food bloggers who have genuine credibility within the community, rather than merely using celebrities with tangential connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building upon authentic representation, adaptive product development—often termed \"glocalization\"—is a critical technique for bridging cultural gaps. This strategy involves modifying a core product to suit local tastes, dietary restrictions, and consumption occasions. This can range from subtle adjustments, such as altering spice levels or sweetness to align with regional palates, to more significant innovations like creating halal-certified versions of prepared meals or developing vegan alternatives to traditionally meat-centric dishes to cater to diverse ethical and religious dietary norms. The success of global chains like McDonald's, which offers McSpicy Paneer in India or Teriyaki Burgers in Japan, exemplifies this approach. However, for specialized food marketers, the technique can be more refined. It might involve creating convenient, ready-to-cook versions of complex traditional dishes, like Korean bibimbap or Nigerian jollof rice kits, that respect the original flavor profile while acknowledging the time constraints of modern consumers. This adaptation signals respect for the consumer's palate and lifestyle, positioning the brand as an enabler of cultural culinary practice rather than a dilutor of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the most dynamic techniques are found in community-centric engagement. Multicultural marketing cannot be a one-way broadcast; it must foster dialogue and participation. This involves creating marketing campaigns that are not just *for* a cultural group but *with* them. Tactics include sponsoring and actively participating in cultural festivals, food fairs, and holiday celebrations like Diwali, Lunar New Year, or Eid, where sampling and immersive experiences can directly connect the product to its cultural context. Digital community building is equally vital, through culturally specific social media channels, recipe development contests that invite consumers to share their own uses for a product, and content that highlights customer stories and family traditions. A brand marketing Caribbean ingredients, for instance, might run a campaign inviting customers to share their family's curry goat recipe, thereby leveraging user-generated content and building a sense of shared ownership. This approach transforms consumers from passive buyers into active brand advocates within their communities, creating powerful organic word-of-mouth networks that are far more credible than traditional advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, these techniques must be deployed with ethical caution. The line between appreciation and appropriation is thin. Marketing that reduces a rich culture to a mere aesthetic or fails to acknowledge origins can provoke backlash. Therefore, the overarching technique is one of partnership and reciprocity—working with cultural consultants, sourcing ingredients ethically from origin communities, and giving back through initiatives that support those communities. In conclusion, the most effective multicultural food marketing techniques are those that combine authenticity, intelligent adaptation, and genuine community engagement. In an era where consumers are increasingly discerning and value-driven, success lies not in selling a generic product to a global audience, but in thoughtfully connecting a product’s unique cultural essence to the lived experiences and identities of diverse consumers, thereby enriching the global food landscape with respect and integrity.\n",

      "One of the most popular Disney movies to date, Bankroft’s Mulan, which was released in 1998, presents a captivating story in a unique setting. In their work, the writers challenge the very norms of society to present a highly charismatic set of characters. In this essay, the changes in Mulan’s identity as a woman that are shown to the audience in the first part of the movie will be discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the very beginning, it becomes clear that the gender roles in the movie are expected to be strictly upheld within society. The norms of the ancient Chinese community are clearly shown from the first minutes of the movie, as Mulan is being prepared to be wed (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 0:6:30). Her role as a woman is to bring honor to her family (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 0:6:57). Although she initially attempts to fit in, this setup is only an obstacle in Mulan’s path to the future she herself decides to choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rejection Mulan receives is a critical point for her character. She understands that she will never succeed at the path that is not her own (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 0:12:05). However, choosing one’s fate as a woman of that era is a nigh-impossible task. Honor is what pushes Mulan to make a decision to challenge the otherwise predefined role that was set for her and take her father’s place in the army.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Mulan experiences a shocking revelation that she will not succeed as a woman in this community, making her rethink the very meaning of honor on which her goal was set. She decides to choose her role herself, showing immense strength of character, care, and true devotion for her family. In this strictly hierarchical setting, Mulan’s actions are a challenge to the very foundation of society.\n",

      "Mulan Disney Film Directed by Bancroft & Cook Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1998 animated film *Mulan*, directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, transcends its surface narrative of a young woman disguising herself as a soldier to explore a profound journey of self-actualization. While the plot is driven by the external conflict of the Hun invasion, the film’s core argument centers on the protagonist’s internal struggle to reconcile her authentic identity with rigid societal expectations. Ultimately, *Mulan* posits that true honor and strength are derived not from blind conformity to prescribed gender roles, but from the courage to define oneself, thereby challenging and ultimately transforming the very norms that sought to constrain her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mulan’s initial identity is defined entirely by the patriarchal society of imperial China, which values women solely as brides who bring honor through obedience and appearance. Her failure at the Matchmaker’s ceremony, culminating in the declaration that she will “never bring her family honor” (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 00:12:15), visually and narratively establishes the conflict between her innate qualities—intelligence, ingenuity, and spirit—and the passive, decorative role she is expected to perform. This failure catalyzes her radical decision to take her father’s place in the army, an act that is simultaneously dishonorable in its deception yet deeply filial in its motivation to protect her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "The persona of “Ping” allows Mulan to cultivate the strengths society denied her female identity. Her success is not achieved through masculine brute force but through the application of her unique intellect and resilience, as demonstrated when she uses ingenuity to retrieve the arrow from the pole (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 00:42:30). The climactic confrontation with Shan Yu further solidifies this thesis. Mulan defeats the Hun leader not with a soldier’s sword, but with a combination of the very “feminine” tool of a fan and the strategic mind she has always possessed (Bancroft & Cook, 1998, 01:15:10). Her victory is a synthesis, not a rejection, of her complete self.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, *Mulan* presents a narrative arc where personal authenticity triumphs over social prescription. By saving China using the unique qualities she was once punished for, Mulan redefines the concept of honor for herself, her family, and her empire. The film’s resolution, where the Emperor bows to her and her family receives the accolades of the nation, signifies a societal recognition that the greatest strength lies in the courage to be one’s true self, thereby offering a powerful critique of rigid gender binaries.\n",

      "Mulan Disney Film Directed by Bancroft & Cook Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "Disney’s *Mulan* (1998), directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, stands as a culturally significant text within the studio’s canon, ostensibly breaking from the traditional “princess” paradigm to engage with themes of gender performativity and filial duty. However, a critical examination reveals that its celebrated progressive surface masks a complex negotiation between subversive potential and conventional Disney formula. This essay argues that while *Mulan* challenges certain gender norms, its feminist and cultural politics are ultimately constrained by commercial imperatives and Western ideological frameworks, resulting in a narrative that appropriates Chinese culture to promote an individualistic model of empowerment. The analysis will proceed by deconstructing the film’s treatment of gender, critiquing its cultural representations, and acknowledging its commercial compromises.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film’s most potent subversion lies in its deconstruction of rigid gender roles through Mulan’s cross-dressing and military success. Her performative acts of “being a man” expose gender as a constructed identity, challenging the essentialist notions presented in “Make a Man Out of You.” Yet, this subversion is narratively contained. The conclusion re-domesticates Mulan through the romantic plot with Captain Shang and her celebrated return to the family hearth. Ultimately, her heroism is validated within a heteronormative framework, subtly reinscribing the very norms her journey initially disrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding cultural representation, the film employs Chinese iconography—the Great Wall, ancestral spirits, and a dragon—as a stylized aesthetic backdrop that manufactures a sense of “authenticity” for Western audiences. More critically, it simplifies and distorts core Confucian values. The profound concepts of *filial piety* and collective familial honor are reshaped into a narrative of individual self-discovery and rebellion against tradition, a theme more palatable to Western individualism than a genuine engagement with Chinese philosophical complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Counterarguments rightly note the film’s positive role as a mainstream conduit for themes of female agency and Chinese culture, fostering cross-cultural understanding for a global audience. Furthermore, within the Disney canon, Mulan undeniably represents meaningful progress, offering a heroine whose primary arc extends beyond securing a romantic marriage to encompass familial salvation and personal integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, *Mulan* operates as an profoundly ambivalent text, simultaneously challenging and conforming to dominant ideologies of gender and culture. Its lasting impact lies in this very tension, making it a rich subject for analyzing how popular culture negotiates representation within a global marketplace. This analysis suggests important implications for contemporary discourse, highlighting the ongoing responsibilities and challenges of authentic storytelling in an era of remakes and globalized media production.\n",
