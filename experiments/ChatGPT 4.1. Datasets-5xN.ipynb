      "12 Years a Slave: An Analysis of the Film Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2013 film 12 Years a Slave proved that slavery is a worldwide issue. Indeed, the film made $150 million outside the United States and $57 million in the U.S., with a production budget of $20 million (Sharf, 2020). The movie was based on the memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup (Ntim, 2020). It tells the story of a free African American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Solomon spent twelve years away from his family, being traded from one master to another. Fortunately, the protagonist met a person who helped him deliver a message to his family and friends, who came and rescued him. This movie accurately illustrates discriminatory relationships between white slaveholders and black slaves that stemmed from the dysfunctional system in the country and prejudices in people’s mindsets at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main ethnic groups presented in this film are White and African Americans, and the three social groups are affluent slaveholders, working for middle class, and enslaved people. The movie starts with the story of a free African American violinist Solomon Northup, living with his family in Saratoga, New York (McQueen, 2013). However, he was abducted by two white men, who tortured the man and sold him into slavery, changing his name to Plat. Before they met, Solomon and these two slave traders belonged to the same middle class. However, the fact that Northup was an African American made these individuals believe that they had the right to withdraw their freedom. The two masters that Solomon had were William Ford and Edwin Epps (McQueen, 2013). The former was kind and religious, while the latter was cruel and sadistic. Since the movie was based on a real story, it indicated that slaveholders had different characters, but all had the wrong perception of race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although 12 Years a Slave is a film about slavery, the issues of collectivism and individualism are also raised. Specifically, the main character never identified himself as an enslaved man and continued claiming he was a free citizen (McQueen, 2013). However, his counterparts on the plant had a collective mindset, imprinted in them since childhood, that slavery is normal. These people helped each other because they belonged to the same group. Although Solomon tried to become a part of this community, his individual goal to return home was above the collective values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie also showed prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people. For instance, when Ford brings Solomon and Elisa to his plantation, his wife expresses her sadness that Elisa got separated from her children. However, she also stated that “something to eat and some rest” could help that woman forget her children (McQueen, 2013, 32:47-32:51). This scene demonstrated the common prejudice about slaves that they were not capable of the same feelings as white people. An example of generalization and stereotyping was how Tibeats, a carpenter, became hostile to Solomon when he showed his intelligence and gave Ford advice. In fact, Tibeats believed that Plat would never be more competent than any white individual because Plat was a “nigger” (McQueen, 2013, 36:35-36:37). Notably, before Northup became enslaved, he never experienced discrimination, but when the main character was sold into slavery, discrimination was the only attitude that he could observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, 12 Years a Slave depicts the life of enslaved people and slave owners almost two centuries ago. The film narrates a free black man’s life from the moment when he enjoyed his family’s company in the state of New York to his abduction, enslavement, and eventual liberation. Overall, the movie raised such critical issues as discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping, and generalization that allowed slaveholders to maintain this societal structure for a long time.\n",

      "Max Weber: Types of Domination Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "Max Weber, a prominent German sociologist, developed a nuanced analysis of power and authority through his concept of \"types of domination.\" According to Weber, domination refers to the probability that certain specific commands from a given person or group will be obeyed by a specified group of people. He identified three ideal types of legitimate domination: traditional, charismatic, and legal-rational. Each type represents a different basis for the legitimacy of authority and the way in which obedience is secured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional domination is rooted in established customs and longstanding practices. Under this type, authority is accepted because it has always existed; people obey because \"it has always been that way.\" Monarchies and feudal systems, where rulers command respect through heredity or centuries-old norms, exemplify traditional domination. In contrast, charismatic domination relies on the personal qualities and extraordinary leadership of an individual. Followers accept the leader’s authority because they perceive him or her as possessing special characteristics, heroism, or a divine calling. Historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi or Joan of Arc often exemplify charismatic domination, as their followers are drawn to their unique persona.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal-rational domination, however, is grounded in a belief in the legitimacy of formally enacted rules and laws. Authority is vested not in a person or tradition, but in the office or system itself. Modern bureaucratic states and institutions operate on this basis, where commands are obeyed because they are in accordance with established procedures and legal statutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weber emphasized that these types are \"ideal types,\" meaning they are theoretical constructs rarely found in pure form in reality. In practice, most societies and organizations blend elements of all three. Nonetheless, Weber’s analysis offers a powerful framework for understanding the sources and structures of authority, revealing how societies organize power and maintain order across different historical and cultural contexts.\n",

      "Max Weber: Types of Domination Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "Background Context\n",
      "\n",
      "Max Weber, a foundational figure in modern sociology, contributed significantly to the understanding of authority and social organization. Central to his work is the concept of domination: the probability that specific commands will be obeyed by a given group of people. Weber's analysis of domination provides a framework for examining how legitimacy is constructed and maintained within societies. His typology of domination has profound implications for the study of politics, bureaucracy, and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of Domination in Weberian Theory\n",
      "\n",
      "Weber identified three pure types of legitimate domination: traditional, charismatic, and legal-rational. Traditional domination is anchored in established customs or long-standing practices, as seen in monarchies and patriarchal systems. Here, authority derives its legitimacy from heritage and continuity rather than legal codes or individual characteristics. Charismatic domination, on the other hand, rests on the personal appeal or extraordinary qualities of a leader. Followers obey because they believe in the leader's vision, as exemplified by revolutionary leaders or religious prophets. Finally, legal-rational domination is grounded in a system of rational laws and formal procedures. Modern bureaucratic states and institutions embody this form, where power is exercised through established rules rather than personal lineage or charisma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implications and Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Weber’s distinction among types of domination highlights the dynamic nature of authority and its institutional foundations. For instance, the transition from traditional to legal-rational authority illustrated the modernization of Western societies, where bureaucracies replaced feudal structures. Furthermore, the concept of charismatic authority explains the rise of social movements under influential individuals, often leading to significant social change. Understanding these types aids in analyzing the stability and change in political systems, organizational management, and social hierarchies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Weber's typology of domination remains a cornerstone in the analysis of authority and legitimacy in sociology. By distinguishing among traditional, charismatic, and legal-rational domination, Weber provides a nuanced lens to study the evolution and functioning of social institutions. His framework continues to inform both theoretical research and practical considerations in understanding power relations.\n",

      "Example output:\n",
      "In Weber’s sociology, the notion “ideal type” can be referred to as an abstract model that is used as a basis for comparison and helps view the real world in a more systematic way. According to Ritzer (2016), under the concept of ideal types, Weber understood the identification of the individuality of development processes and the characteristics that caused these differences. In addition, Max Weber defines three main types of domination or authority that include legal, charismatic, and traditional authority. Traditional domination is generally legitimized by specific cultural and traditional patterns, charismatic – by a strong personality or character that can lead to obedience, and the legal authority means the legitimization of power by governmental regulations and laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, legal domination strongly relies on laws, governmental regulations, and rules that society considers appropriate and fair. The current system of power in the United States can be taken as an example of legal authority. The traditional type of domination is based on following traditional examples, and the power generally relies on experience and the lessons of the past. According to Durkheim (1952), historically traditionalism remains much stronger in the Midi, while Northern countries managed to change this form of authority. An example of this type of authority is the existing political system of Saudi Arabia, where the king is allowed to rule the country due to historical customs, and the citizens do not confront this type of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last domination type is charismatic and is based on people’s beliefs in specific and exceptional characteristics of a political leader. It usually occurs during periods of political instability such as revolutions, strikes, civil wars; however, this type of power can be observed in several countries as an integral part of the authoritative system. For instance, the dictatorship of Julius Cesar, who occupied the ruling position in Rome without any legal support, formed a cult of personality.\n",

      "Maya Angelou Deserves a Monument Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "Maya Angelou is a name synonymous with resilience, creativity, and social change, and her contributions to literature and activism mark her as one of the most influential figures in American history. Throughout her long career, Angelou broke barriers not only as a Black woman but also as a poet, memoirist, and champion for civil rights. Given her lasting impact on the cultural and ethical landscape of the United States, it is undeniable that Maya Angelou deserves a monument dedicated to her achievements. Such a monument would not merely commemorate a remarkable individual, but it would serve as an enduring inspiration for generations to come, highlighting the values of courage, empathy, and perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angelou’s literary works, especially her beloved autobiography “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” offered an authentic and unfiltered perspective on the complexities of race, gender, and identity in America. Her writing gave voice to the marginalized and conveyed the universal struggle for dignity and self-realization. Through her elegant prose and poetry, Angelou articulated the pain of her experiences, from trauma and discrimination to eventual triumph, in a way that resonated powerfully with readers worldwide. A monument in her honor would recognize not only her artistic genius but also her role in expanding the boundaries of American literature and bringing the narratives of Black women to the forefront of cultural consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond her literary accomplishments, Angelou played a pivotal role as an activist during the Civil Rights Movement. She worked closely with leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, advocating for justice and equality. Her life’s work went far beyond the written word; she transformed grief and strife into social action, educating and motivating others to fight for a more just society. Honoring Angelou with a monument would serve as a tribute to her efforts in the struggle for human rights and offer a physical representation of the values she championed throughout her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Maya Angelou’s significance lies in her ability to uplift and empower others. As a teacher, speaker, and mentor, she inspired countless individuals to embrace their unique potential and to rise above adversity. Her poetry, including the iconic “Still I Rise,” has become a rallying cry for those confronting injustice, offering hope and encouragement across generations. A monument to Angelou would not simply celebrate her personal accomplishments, but would serve as a reminder to all that resilience and integrity can lead to transformative change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a monument to Maya Angelou would provide a crucial touchstone for communities seeking to recognize the often-overlooked contributions of Black women to American society. It would align with the ongoing movement to diversify the public memory, ensuring that the stories and achievements of those who have historically been marginalized are elevated and celebrated. Such a tribute would encourage reflection on the progress that has been made and a recommitment to the ongoing work of equality and justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, Maya Angelou deserves a monument because her legacy transcends her own lifetime. She paved the way for future generations, using the power of words and activism to challenge societal norms and advocate for universal human dignity. A monument to her would stand as a testament to the extraordinary power of courage, compassion, and the enduring impact of art in the pursuit of social justice.\n",

      "In Weber’s sociology, the notion “ideal type” can be referred to as an abstract model that is used as a basis for comparison and helps view the real world in a more systematic way. According to Ritzer (2016), under the concept of ideal types, Weber understood the identification of the individuality of development processes and the characteristics that caused these differences. In addition, Max Weber defines three main types of domination or authority that include legal, charismatic, and traditional authority. Traditional domination is generally legitimized by specific cultural and traditional patterns, charismatic – by a strong personality or character that can lead to obedience, and the legal authority means the legitimization of power by governmental regulations and laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, legal domination strongly relies on laws, governmental regulations, and rules that society considers appropriate and fair. The current system of power in the United States can be taken as an example of legal authority. The traditional type of domination is based on following traditional examples, and the power generally relies on experience and the lessons of the past. According to Durkheim (1952), historically traditionalism remains much stronger in the Midi, while Northern countries managed to change this form of authority. An example of this type of authority is the existing political system of Saudi Arabia, where the king is allowed to rule the country due to historical customs, and the citizens do not confront this type of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last domination type is charismatic and is based on people’s beliefs in specific and exceptional characteristics of a political leader. It usually occurs during periods of political instability such as revolutions, strikes, civil wars; however, this type of power can be observed in several countries as an integral part of the authoritative system. For instance, the dictatorship of Julius Cesar, who occupied the ruling position in Rome without any legal support, formed a cult of personality.\n",

      "Max Weber: Types of Domination Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "Max Weber’s theory of domination constitutes a central element in his sociological analysis of authority and power within society. Domination, in Weber’s framework, refers to the probability that specific commands from a given source will be obeyed by a particular group of people (Weber, 1978). He distinguishes between various types of domination based on the legitimacy that actors attribute to the source of authority. The three ideal types identified by Weber are traditional, charismatic, and legal-rational domination, each grounded in distinct legitimating principles (Ritzer, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional domination derives its legitimacy from established customs, long-standing practices, or inherited status. Under traditional domination, such as that evident in patriarchal households or feudal monarchies, obedience is owed because authority is sanctified by age-old customs and social structures. The authority of a tribal elder or a hereditary king exemplifies this form, as loyalty is rooted primarily in tradition rather than any codified laws or personal qualities of the leader (Weber, 1978).\n",
      "\n",
      "Charismatic domination, in contrast, is based on devotion to the exceptional sanctity, heroism, or exemplary character of an individual leader. Followers submit to authority because they perceive extraordinary attributes in the individual, as observed in revolutionary leaders or religious prophets. Leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi or Joan of Arc illustrate charismatic domination, where the legitimacy of command resides in personal charisma and the leader’s ability to inspire allegiance, often resulting in radical social change (Gerth & Mills, 1946).\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal-rational domination is typified by obedience to a system of rules and laws that are formally enacted. Authority resides in the office or position, not in any individual occupying that position, as found in modern bureaucratic states and organizations. For instance, police officers or civil servants exercise authority by virtue of the legal rules underpinning their office, and legitimacy is maintained through conformity to impersonal regulations (Weber, 1978; Ritzer, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Weber’s typology of domination offers a systematic framework for understanding how authority is legitimated and maintained in different social contexts, illustrating the diversity and complexity of power relations in both historical and contemporary societies.\n",

      "Max Weber: Types of Domination Essay\n",
      "\n",
      "Max Weber stands as a foundational figure in the sociology of authority and power, offering a systematic account of how leadership and control are legitimized within social structures. Central to Weber’s theory is the concept of domination (Herrschaft), understood as the probability that certain commands will be obeyed by a group of people. This essay critically examines Weber’s tripartite classification of domination—traditional, charismatic, and legal-rational—highlighting their core characteristics, social implications, and enduring relevance for contemporary society.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of domination occupies a prominent place in Weber’s sociological framework, referring not merely to the exercise of power (Macht), but to forms of authority that are recognized as legitimate by subordinates. Weber’s methodological approach involved distinguishing between power, which is based on force or coercion, and domination, which rests on accepted forms of legitimacy. This differentiation allowed him to categorize authority according to the sources from which they derive their legitimacy and the social order they produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional domination is founded upon an established belief in the sanctity of age-old customs, practices, and social structures. Legitimacy in this form derives from unwritten rules and inherited practices, as seen historically in monarchies and patriarchal systems. Mechanisms such as hereditary succession and ritualized ceremonies reinforce traditional authority, but these same mechanisms can render it inflexible and resistant to social change, making traditional domination increasingly vulnerable in the face of modernization and rationalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charismatic domination, by contrast, is based on devotion to the exceptional sanctity, heroism, or exemplary character of an individual leader. As seen in revolutionary movements or the rise of visionary leaders, charismatic authority can disrupt established social orders and inspire radical change. However, its personal and emotional nature results in inherent instability; the authority’s survival is often contingent upon the continued presence and perceived legitimacy of the charismatic figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal-rational domination represents authority grounded in formally enacted rules and rationally designed institutions. It characterizes modern bureaucratic states and capitalist economies, where legitimacy arises from adherence to written laws and procedures, rather than tradition or personal qualities. This form’s perceived legitimacy is reinforced by its impersonality, predictability, and efficiency, fostering the emergence of complex organizational forms and facilitating large-scale social coordination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its influence, Weber’s typology has attracted criticism for its perceived rigidity and Eurocentrism. Critics argue that his framework inadequately accounts for the diversity and hybridity of authority in non-Western or contemporary settings. Alternative perspectives, such as Michel Foucault’s analysis of diffuse power relations or Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of symbolic power, offer more flexible conceptualizations of authority that address informal and network-based forms of domination, which challenge strict application of Weber’s schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Weber’s threefold classification of domination remains instrumental in dissecting the foundations of authority and institutional order. While his typology illuminates the key sources of legitimacy and social stability, it also demands re-examination and integration with alternative theories, especially in light of increasingly complex and globalized authority configurations. Future research should further explore how these ideal types intersect and evolve, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of authority in the contemporary era.\n",
